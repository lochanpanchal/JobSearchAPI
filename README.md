## Project Summary
The Job Portal Search API built using Spring Boot is a powerful tool that allows developers to integrate job search functionality into their applications. It provides a standardized interface for searching and retrieving job listings from various sources, making it easier for users to find relevant employment opportunities.

The API leverages the Spring Boot framework, which simplifies the development process by providing out-of-the-box features such as dependency management, configuration, and web service support. By utilizing Spring Boot, developers can focus on implementing the core functionality of the API without getting bogged down in boilerplate code.
